# UI Reference

Many apps that I build require the same kinds of UI elements and interactions. This is a reference repository showing some of those patterns.

### What this is not

A UI component library that you can `npm install` and begin using. Instead, it's code that you can look at that may help you implement some of
these things in your own app.
