# Popover

A popover is a [modal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window) that is positioned in relation
to another element on the page, typically the button that displays it.

The difference between a Popover and a Dialog is that the Dialog is always centered on the screen. Aside
from that detail, the interaction design of both of these components is identical.
